# Task 4: Non-IID Dataset (5 Points)

In reality, the data on which we train is of course not the same across different end devices. 

We simulate this by distributing the data unevenly across the clients. You can simply cut the data set into smaller parts, in which case data is distributed unequally by label.

Examine the performance of your algorithm if you now only update after 3 local batches.

Compare your solution with regard to ’accuracy’ with your solution from the
previous task. 

Visualize your results.
