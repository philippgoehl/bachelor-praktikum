# Task 5: Report & Presentation (10 Points)

## Task 5.1 (4 Points)

Present your approach and results in a presentation during the final event.

## Task 5.2 (6 Pints)

Write a report in which you reflect on your work and learning progress.
The principle of “as much as necessary, as little as possible” applies. Get
to the core of your statements. (Guideline: max. approx. 10 pages).

## Tip

When you prepare your slide set, use laTeX (beamer). A template with
laTeX for the report can be found in e-Learning.
