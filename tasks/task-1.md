# Task 1: Setup / Concept (10 Points)

Read the tasks 2-4 and create a setup and a concept / sketch for your programs.

## Tips

- Use an editor with highlighting for all code segments (e.g. VS Code, JetBrains (PyCharm), Eclipse)
- Use the Framework Flower (flwr) from flower.ai
- Use Docker instead of a virtual machine for your setup (consult the Documentation), you can find a functional template in the course on e-Learning.
- Document your work during the following tasks and comment on you code sufficiently (will be included in the grade).
