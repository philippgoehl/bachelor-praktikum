# FAQ

She uploaded the dataset to Hugging Face, which we can use for our tasks.

## Q1: How can we determine what is required to receive full points for each task? Should we contact you before each submission to clarify the expectations?

Each task is graded based on five criteria:

- 1 point for Research
- 1 point for Code
- 1 point for Visualization
- 1 point for Documentation
- 1 point for Experimentation

(She will upload this rubric to eLearning.)

If you completely rewrite the code, that’s not ideal. However, if you extend existing code, that shows continuity, which is encouraged.

## Q2: Is it acceptable to keep all tasks in a single repository, or should we create a separate repository for each task?

There is no access to the Git history, so it’s fine to use a single repository for all tasks.

## Q3: For Task 1: Is there a general conceptual outline or structure that the program should follow?

The structure is completely up to us. However, it’s recommended to design the code in a way that is extensible for the following tasks.
Continuity across tasks is important.

## Q4: Are we expected to modify the provided `docker-compose` template throughout the course, or should we leave it unchanged?

We can modify the docker-compose files if needed.

## Q5: For Task 2, should the visualization be implemented using **matplotlib**, since it is listed as a dependency in the `requirements.txt` file?

We can use matplotlib, but it’s not mandatory.
Matplotlib is recommended, but Cyclic Plot (Cyplot) or other modern visualization libraries are also acceptable.

## Q6: Should we only use the libraries specified in the provided `requirements.txt`, or are we allowed to extend them with additional dependencies?

We can extend the requirements.txt with additional dependencies if necessary.

## Q7: For questions or clarifications, should we contact **you** directly, or should we reach out to **Nikita**?

All questions should be directed to Nikita (that’s her).

## Q8 Should we already know the basic information from the theory?

Not necessarily — but having some background knowledge helps.
The difficult part is not writing the code, but understanding what the code actually does.

## Changes to the Task Sheet

Changes have been made to Task 3:

- The dataset should be distributed identically to ten clients.
- If you have ten datasets, each client should receive at least one data point.
- The distribution should be identical, not random.

The corrected task sheet has been uploaded.
Additionally, the dataset has changed from MNIST to EMNIST.

## Note to the presentation

The presentation should be 10 minutes long.
