## \_ (Underscore) in Python

In Python, the underscore `_` has a special meaning in various contexts.

- `_` is used as a placeholder for a value that is not used.
- `_` is used to separate the digits of a numeric literal for better readability.
- `_` is used to indicate that a variable is private.
- `_` is used to indicate that a function is private.
- `_` is used to ignore the value of a variable in unpacking.
- `_` is used to indicate that a variable is temporary or insignificant.
- `_` is used to indicate the result of the last expression in an interactive interpreter session.

```python
# Placeholder
for _ in range(5):
    print("Hello")

# Numeric literal
number = 1_000_000

# Private variable
_private_variable = 10

# Private function (should not be imported)
def _private_function():
    pass

# Ignore value in unpacking
a, _, c = (1, 2, 3)

# Temporary or insignificant variable
for _ in range(10):
    print("Hello")

# Result of the last expression
10 + 20
_  # 30
```

## Scope

Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside the function. 
Variables defined outside any function are global and can be accessed from any function.

```python
def my_function():
    x = 10
    print(x)

my_function()  # 10

# This will raise an error
# print(x)
# NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

You can use the `global` keyword to access and modify global variables from within a function.

```python
x = 10

def my_function():
    global x
    x = 20

my_function()
print(x)  # 20
```

Inside block, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword to access and modify variables from an outer (but non-global) scope.

```python
def outer_function():
    x = 10

    def inner_function():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20

    inner_function()
    print(x)

outer_function()  # 20
```

The scope of a variable inside a try- except block is the block itself.

```python
try:
    x = 10
    raise Exception
except:
    pass

# This will raise an error
# print(x)
# NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```
