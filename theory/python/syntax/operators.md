# Operators

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. 
The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

## Arithmetic Operators

- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus)
- `**` (Exponentiation)
- `//` (Floor Division)

## Assignment Operators

- `=` (Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand)
- `+=` (Adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand)
- `-=` (Subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand)
- `*=` (Multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand)
- `/=` (Divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand)
- `%=` (Takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand)
- `**=` (Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `//=` (Performs floor division on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `&=` (Performs Bitwise AND on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `|=` (Performs Bitwise OR on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `^=` (Performs Bitwise XOR on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `>>=` (Performs Bitwise right shift on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `<<=` (Performs Bitwise left shift on operators and assigns value to the left operand)
- `:=` (Assigns values to variables as part of an expression)

## Comparison Operators

- `==` (Equal)
- `!=` (Not equal)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

## Logical Operators

- `and` (Returns True if both statements are true)
- `or` (Returns True if one of the statements is true)
- `not` (Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true)

## Identity Operators

- `is` (Returns True if both variables are the same object)
- `is not` (Returns True if both variables are not the same object)

## Membership Operators

- `in` (Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object)
- `not in` (Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object)

## Bitwise Operators

- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Zero fill left shift)
- `>>` (Signed right shift)

## Prescedence of Operators

The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. 
Operators with higher precedence are applied first.

- `( )` (Parentheses)
- `**` (Exponentiation)
- `+x`, `-x`, `~x` (Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT)
- `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus)
- `+`, `-` (Addition, Subtraction)
- `<<`, `>>` (Bitwise shift operators)
- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)
- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `is`, `is not`, `in`, `not in` (Comparisons, Identity, Membership operators)
- `not` (Logical NOT)
- `and` (Logical AND)
- `or` (Logical OR)
