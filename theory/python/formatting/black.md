# Black

A good way to format your code is using the `black` code formatter. 
It is a Python code formatter that reformats your code to make it more readable.
It is a great tool to use when you are working on a project with multiple developers, as it ensures that the code is formatted consistently.

To install `black`, run:

```bash
pip install black
```

To format a file, run:

```bash
black <filename>
```

To format all Python files in a directory, run:

```bash
black <directory>
```

Example:

```python
black .
```
