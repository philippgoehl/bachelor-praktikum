# Pylint

`Pylint` is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard, and looks for code smells.
It is a great tool to use when you want to ensure that your code is clean and follows best practices.

To install `pylint`, run:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

To run `pylint` on a file, run:

```bash
pylint <filename>
```

To run `pylint` on all Python files in a directory, run:

```bash
pylint <directory>
```

To run `pylint` on the current directory, you can use:

```bash
pylint .
```
